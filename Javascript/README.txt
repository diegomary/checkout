Here we I am presenting 2 different solutions for the JavaScript implementation.

They differ only slightly in the way the offers are calculated.

Here in contrast with the java solution I have used Dynamic programming and a more functional approach

In my opinion the MVP of the given products be product B.

I have  flagged the offers so that a product administrator can decide if the offer 
for a certain product can be on air or not.



The development has used the following environment.
Node.js version 10.13.0
Editor: Visual studio code with built in Node debugger.
All native node features.
No external frameworks.
