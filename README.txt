As per your kind request I am hereby presenting my solutions to the test you administered.

Please consider the first required solution in the java language located under the java folder.

In addition I wanted to add another solution in javascript which can be be perused in the javascript folder.
The reason for this adjunct is to underline the difference of approach between the 2 languages.

Since in JS objects are more opened to extensions at run time the JS solution might better honour the 2nd solid principle.

I really like them both equally but nowadays the tendency to adopt javascript even in the backend seems
widespread and lasting in the future. As a consequence I wanted to demonstrate my fluency on js that extends of course amply in the frontend development.


Kindest regards

Diego
