As per your kind request I am hereby presenting my solutions to the test you administered.

Please consider the first required solution in the java language located under the java folder.

In addition I wanted to add another solution in javascript which can be be perused in the javascript folder.
The reason for this adjunct is to underline the difference of approach between the 2 languages.

Since in JS objects are more open to extensions at run time the JS solution might better honour the 2nd solid principle.

I really like them both equally but nowadays the tendency to adopt javascript even in the backend seems
widespread and prone to last in the future. As a consequence, I wanted to demonstrate my fluency on js that also amply extends in the frontend development.

In regards to the question related to extra points, I would like to suggest a strategy at the till where we can interface real time with the product repository end edit the offers.
Reactive programming would come in handy in this case. 

Kindest regards,

Diego
